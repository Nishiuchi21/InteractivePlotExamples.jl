# InteractivePlotExamples.jl

A collection of examples of interactive plots using [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org).
The excellent website [Beautiful Makie](https://beautiful.makie.org/) has lots of great examples using Makie.jl, but it's still hard to find somewhat more complex examples using GLMakie's interactive features. Making interactive plots in Makie is quite easy compared to a lot of other software, and can be an important part of a workflow for visualizing data or models. Hopefully these examples are a great starting point for more ideas.
