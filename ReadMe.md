# InteractivePlotExamples.jl

A collection of examples of interactive plots using [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org).
The excellent website [Beautiful Makie](https://beautiful.makie.org/) has lots of examples of static plots in Makie.jl, but there are few demonstrating the interactive abilities of GLMakie. Making interactive plots is quite easy compared to a lot of other software, and can be a crucial part of a workflow for visualizing data or models. Hopefully these examples are a great starting point for more ideas.
